Description: CAN-Bus to MQTT-Bridge
 can2mqtt can2mqtt is a small piece of software written in Go. Its
 purpose is to be a bridge between a CAN-Bus and a MQTT-Broker. Those
 are completely different worlds but they have similiaritys in the way
 they are built. I think i don't have to speak about the differences
 so i will just pick up the similiarities: In the CAN-world you have
 so called CAN-Frames. Each CAN-Frame can contain up to eight bytes of
 payload and CAN-Frame has an ID. In the MQTT-world you have topics and
 messages. Each message has a specific topic. As you can see it should be
 possible to map CAN-IDs to MQTT-Topics and their respective payload to
 messages.
